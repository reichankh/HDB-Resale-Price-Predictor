## Description
HDB resale value today goes beyond traditional factors like distance to the nearest MRT station or remaining lease. The model incorporates a wider mix of micro factors (e.g., floor area, block height, proximity to amenities - mall/hawker centre, distance to nearest popular primary schools, neighbourhood affluency) and macro drivers (e.g., inflation (CPI), household income (MHI), GDP growth, upcoming MRT station).

The product combines multiple factors into a single resale price prediction, presenting HDB values in a holistic way. It provides buyers and agents with credible insights to support confident and data-driven decisions.

## ML Model Results
4 ML models (LightGBM, CatBoost, Random Forest, Extra Trees) were built to learn and predict the HDB resale prices.

Below is an overview of the models and their performance outcomes:

LightGBM achieved the best balance of train and test accuracy, model discrepancies and runtime. It delivered a strong predictive performance with no significant overfitting.


## Conclusion
Our analysis shows that remaining lease, MRT proximity, flat size and type, storey level, neighbourhood affluence, and proximity to popular schools are key drivers of HDB resale prices, with premiums seen in CBD areas and locations with strong MRT access. Macro factors such as inflation (CPI), household income (MHI), economic growth (GDP), and government policies also influence market demand and pricing trends.

The model combines these micro and macro insights into a data-driven price estimate, giving buyers, sellers, and agents credible guidance for make confident decisions. 
As the market continues to evolve, incorporating new data sources such as news and sentiment trends can further improve forecast accuracy and capture changes in buyer behaviour.
